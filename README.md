We can use our social media chat data for many data science tasks like sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, named entity recognition, text analysis and several other natural language processing tasks. By analyzing your social media chat messages with certain important people we can find a lot of information from their messages which can also help you to solve many business problems. These types of chat analysis provides insight into the real mood behind the messages.It helps in : Upselling Opportunities , Agent Monitoring , Training chatbots, identifying key emotional triggers, adaptive customer service etc

## About the Project ‚õπÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
In this project we are doing WhatApp chat analysis as WhatsApp is one of the most used messenger applications today with more than 2 Billion users worldwide. It was found that more than 65 billion messages are sent on WhatsApp daily so we can use WhatsApp chats for analyzing our chat with a friend, customer, or a group of people.The same can be done with other social media apps as well. To analyse the water quality, I have used a Kaggle dataset that contains data on all of the major factors that affect the potability of water. All of the factors that affect water quality are very important, so I have briefly explored each feature of this dataset before training the machine learning model to predict whether a water sample is safe or unsuitable for consumption.

## Summary
Through this project  we can analyze the quality of water and train a machine learning model to classify safe and unsafe water for drinking. Access to safe drinking water is one of the essential needs of all human beings. From a legal point of view, access to drinking water is one of the fundamental human rights. Many factors affect water quality, it is also one of the major research areas in machine learning.
